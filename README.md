# Particle Swarm Optimization
#### _Particle swarm optimization algorithm tested on multiple non-convex functions_

Two assignments covering a raw particle swarm optimization (PSO) model, and a hybrid method that incorporates MATLAB's `fmincon` function into the PSO algorithm.

Running scripts:
* For PSO.
  * Run `A2Q1/A2Q1_Main.m`
* For Gradient-based.
  * Run `A2Q2/A2Q2_Main.m`
* For Hybrid PSO
  * Run `A3_Q6.m`
* Scripts will ask for user input for each case study and 'n' value. 

Notes:
* Warnings will occur when running the main scripts for plotting.
  * These warnings can be ignored.
* Plots are only relevant for n = 2.
