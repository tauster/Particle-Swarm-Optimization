# Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle swarm optimization algorithm tested on multiple non-convex functions

Running scripts:
* For PSO.

..* Run A2Q1/A2Q1_Main.m

* For Gradient-based.
..* Run A2Q2/A2Q2_Main.m
* Scripts will ask for user input for each case study and 'n' value. 

Notes:
* Warnings will occur when running the main scripts for plotting.
..* These warnings can be ignored.
* Plots are only relevant for n = 2.
